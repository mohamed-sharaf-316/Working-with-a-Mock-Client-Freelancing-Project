# Working-with-a-Mock-Client-Freelancing-Project
#### This project is basically a demo to demonstrate the processing of working with a client on a freelancing project
#### The process begins with viewing the project listing to understand the project requirements, duration, and payment type
#### Then we respond with an expression of interest to introduce ourselves to the client and showcase our skills needed for the project, discuss terms with the client, technology solutions used for the project development, and explain that we would be working according to the agile model.
#### Trello is used during all project phases so that the client always has a clear understanding of all processes and view progress.
#### Finally an invoice template is sent to the client displaying all project features' prices and amount spent on each, and the payment method to ensure a safe payment
